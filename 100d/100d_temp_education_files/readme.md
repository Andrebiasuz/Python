In this folder, the education materials from the Code100 challenges will be posted. All the interactive coding challenges and the projects which are not flashy enough for a portfolio will be here. Otherwise, the bigger code100 challenges will be in the '100d_projects' folder.

The exercises posted here could be performed in a more professional and complex way, with less lines of code. But the idea is to revisit basic concepts, so the implementation was done as a beginner.
